1,Encouraging Undergraduate Student Experiential Learning through a Community-Based Fall Risk Assessment and Prevention Clinic,"Tyler A. Wood,K. Andrew R. Richards & Jacob J. Sosnoff",23 March 2020,International Journal of Kinesiology in Higher Education,"Community engagement provides kinesiology undergraduate students with valuable experience and allows for personal and professional growth. Kinesiology students often seek out opportunities that pertain to their future career goals. As many of them aspire to allied health professions, working with special populations is of interest, including individuals with movement impairments. As a result of their knowledge of movement and physical activity, kinesiology students are uniquely qualified to quantify and prevent adverse events due to movement impairment, including falls. The purpose of this article is to overview undergraduate students’ involvement in a community-based fall risk assessment and prevention clinic through the lens of experiential learning theory. Collectively, this type of program has the potential to enhance the undergraduates’ educational experience and preparation for their future careers while also enriching the community with fall prevention resources.",https://doi.org/10.1080/24711616.2020.1732249,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24711616.2020.1732249
2,Research Culture: Virtual conferences raise standards for accessibility and interactions,Sarvenaz Sarabipour,"Nov 4, 2020",eLife,"Scientific conferences have an important role in the exchange of ideas and knowledge within the scientific community. Conferences also provide early-career researchers with opportunities to make themselves known within their field of research. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has brought traditional in-person conferences to a halt for the foreseeable future, the growth of virtual conferences has highlighted many of the disadvantages associated with the in-person format and demonstrated the advantages of moving these events online. Here, based on data from in-person and virtual conferences in a range of subjects, we describe how virtual conferences are more inclusive, more affordable, less time-consuming and more accessible worldwide, especially for early-career researchers. Making conferences more open and inclusive will provide both immediate and long-term benefits to the scientific community.",https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.62668,https://elifesciences.org/articles/62668

4,Influential Pathways of Employees' Career Growth: Linkage of Psychological and Organizational Factors Based on Qualitative Comparative Analysis,"Bailin Ge, Zhiqiang Ma, Mingxing Li, Zeyu Li, Ling Yang, Tong Liu",2022 Jan 4,Frontiers in psychology,"Implementing the ""hierarchical diagnosis and treatment"" system highlights the important role of general practitioners as ""residents' health gatekeepers."" Still, the low level of career growth always limits the realization of their service value. Inertial thinking uses a single factor to explain the complexity of career growth in previous studies; in fact, it isn't easy to assess whether the factor is a sufficient and necessary condition for a high level of career growth. Herein, we have used a set theory perspective to analyze the mechanism of influencing high-level career growth by combining psychological and organizational factors. This research aims to analyze causal complexity relationship between these conditions and results is analyzed in detail. We choose fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) with a sample of 407 GPs to test 5 antecedent conditional variables that can affect their career growth. The variables include professional identity, self-efficacy, achievement motivation, training mechanism, and incentive mechanism. To ensure the universality and diversity of data, the samples were selected from community medical institutions in different regions of China. The results show that three pathways can affect the high career growth of GPs, and the optimal pathway A2 is the linkage matching of high incentive mechanism, high professional identity, high achievement motivation, and high self-efficacy. At the same time, we find that professional identity plays an alternative role in the three pathways. When professional identity is at a high level, as long as achievement motivation and self-efficacy are superior, or achievement motivation, self-efficacy, and achievement motivation are superior, a high level of career growth can be achieved. We broke the shackles of previous studies that only focused on the impact of single factors on the career growth of GPs. From the perspective of set theory, we use configurational thinking to construct Influential pathways of high career growth of GPs by integrating antecedents. The results can provide effective support for improving GPs' service ability and realizing their service value to protect residents' health.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.796454,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35058856/

Many HEIs are implementing sustainability practices and projects to counteract climate change, often involving youth participation. The present study aimed at identifying how sustainable communities may be fostered in a university setting. To that end, a questionnaire was administered to engineering students at the start and end of a course on energy issues, assessing their perceptions of sustainability using multi-criteria decision analysis. The results showed that students placed greater value on sustainability at the end of the course. Additionally, the findings highlight that the implementation of projects aimed at tackling real problems may be useful for disseminating knowledge and sustainable practices. The main implications of this study indicate that sustainable communities in academia lay on six foundational pillars: sustainable education, energy (and resource) independence, subsidies in support of the green economy, initiatives aimed at reducing the carbon footprint, energy community development, and new green professional opportunities.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-48021-8,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-48021-8#citeas

7,Social Network Analysis: A Framework for Identifying Communities in Higher Education Online Learning,Shazia K. Jan & Panos Vlachopoulos ,16 July 2018,"Technology, Knowledge and Learning ","This paper presents the Integrated Methodological Framework (IMF) which uses social network analysis (SNA) to structurally identify communities in higher education online learning (HEOL). Decades of research speaks for the value of community-based learning albeit in traditional, blended, or online environments. The communities of practice (CoP) and community of inquiry (CoI) are well-established, empirically tested frameworks that have been effectively used for exploration of community-based learning in professional and educational contexts. Typically, research using these frameworks has required extensive qualitative analysis making it tedious and time-consuming. Pivoting on structural similarities between networks and communities, the IMF embeds SNA constructs in structural components of the CoP and CoI frameworks. By structurally identifying a CoP and CoI, the IMF allows targeted, selective qualitative analysis thus reducing the extent of qualitative analysis required previously in research using the CoP and CoI frameworks. Application of the IMF is demonstrated in a case study on an online blogging network. The study substantiates the IMF as an effective framework for structural identification of a CoP and CoI. The validity and robustness of the IMF is being further tested in ongoing research.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10758-018-9375-y,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10758-018-9375-y#citeas

The focus is on the intentions and dynamics that shape the curriculum process in the local communities of practice (CoPs). The data, comprising interviews with 25 scholars, are examined as experience-centred narratives of curriculum change. Two distinct types of narrative – dialogical and reproductive – are found to reflect how the curriculum change was negotiated. In further analysis, Wenger's dimensions of CoPs, namely, mutual engagement, joint enterprise and shared repertoire, are used as a conceptual framework to identify the intentions and dynamics behind the narratives. The following dimensions emerged: (1) intending to cross borders versus maintaining prevailing traditions and positions; (2) attempting to find shared goals versus delaying or discontinuing the process and (3) having enough curiosity to familiarise oneself with the unfamiliar versus deprecating and rejecting it.",https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2015.1125877,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03075079.2015.1125877

The participants were 27 international master students at a German university. Data were collected from participants’ written narratives-so called value creation stories. A systematic qualitative research approach was employed. Initially, we conducted a theory-driven content analysis to classify members’ attributed values. Subsequently, we performed an emergent data-driven thematic analysis to extrapolate the specifics of attributed values by participants. This study underscores the role of learning community members’ agency in value creation, by having community members, instead of external members, define value creation for themselves, as an individual and collective process and “outcome” enabled by participation in CoLPs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stueduc.2019.05.006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191491X18303146?via%3Dihub

The Covid-19 pandemic brought unprecedented crisis to a world already undergoing digital transformation. Millions of people began working virtually to prevent the spread of disease and to maintain business continuity, suddenly participating in virtual human resource development (VHRD) and alternative work strategies that helped organizations adapt to current challenges and prepare for future disruption. The purpose of this article is to analyze VHRD’s role in the crisis and the transition to a new era marked by further disruption and change.
The Recommendation.
This article provides a primer for understanding the environmental perspective of VHRD, analyzes reskilling and upskilling trends during the pandemic and for early stages of the fourth industrial revolution, and addresses learning, adaptation, cultural, workplace, and economic implications. We argue that many of the changes to the workplace were already underway, but the pandemic has accelerated transformation. For this reason, organizations must anticipate more digital transformation, strategize VHRD, and leverage learning assets to prepare for the future.
The Stakeholders.
This article is of interest to those helping their organizations to not only recover from crisis, but to thrive in a new era of work that is being fundamentally transformed by technology.

Many socio-economic activities have been globally disrupted, leading to the closure of companies and the suspension of work activities, which have drastically increased the unemployment rate and narrowed employment opportunities. This study used a qualitative method to explore the initiatives taken by the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education and University Malaysia Sabah to improve the sustainability of graduate employability in the post-COVID-19 era. The study sample comprised ten officers who are experienced and responsible for organising initiatives for university graduate employability programmes and ten students who participated in these programmes. The study showed that the Short-Term Training and Placement Programme (MySTEP), Career Advancement Programme (Penjana CAP), Professional Certification Programme (Penjana PACE), and Career Advancement Programme at State (Penjana KPT-CAP @ State) were the major initiatives taken by the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education to improve graduate employability in the post-COVID-19 era. The findings also revealed that the university undertook initiatives regarding upskilling and reskilling, the gig economy, entrepreneurship, finishing school programmes, and online career fairs to improve graduate employability rates in the post-COVID-19 era. Interviews with student respondents showed that these initiatives have given them the opportunity to learn and improve on new skills that are necessary to find new job opportunities in the post-COVID-19 era.

14,"An Exploration Of The Experiences Of Modern Marketers: Skills Gaps, Mindset, And The Role Of Career Stage",Tim Crowley,2021,,"The digitalisation of marketing is the greatest change that the marketing profession has experienced (Kähler & Magnusson, 2018) and digital technologies now sit at the forefront of modern marketing (Thomas & Thomas, 2018). Digital marketing has numerous benefits (Kumar, 2015; Malar, 2016), however, digitalisation is disruptive (Mgiba, 2019) and has resulted in mismatched skills and an increased need for reskilling and upskilling (Bajpai & Biberman, 2019). Accordingly, skills gaps are evident (Crush, 2011; Day, 2011; Hege, 2020; Quinn et al., 2016; Royle & Laing, 2014; Wood, 2011). Notwithstanding, there is a scarcity of research in this area (Raghuraman, 2017; Royle & Laing, 2014) especially in terms of studies which investigate the experiences and challenges of marketers within practice (Brady et al., 2008; Leeflang et al., 2014; Quinn et al., 2016; Reibstein et al., 2009; Valos et al., 2010). This study investigates how the lived experiences of modern marketers provide an insight into the interplay between skills gaps and the digital transformation of marketing. A mixed method approach was utilised. Twenty-six in-depth interviews were employed across two cohorts of marketers. A typical 5-point Likert scale survey questionnaire was then utilised which provided further insight into the data. Finally, two online focus groups allowed the researcher to further explore key findings and to present the descriptive model to an informed group of marketers. The key output of this study is a descriptive model which describes the experiences of modern marketers. This model also details an underlying mindset issue. While marketing skills gaps have been noted in literature the data indicates that skills gaps may not be the pertinent issue. Instead, skills gaps appear symptomatic of a fundamental mindset issue. Study findings suggest a misdiagnosis within literature and shift focus from skills gaps to mindset. Furthermore, the role of career stage is accentuated as dissimilar mindsets became evident as early and later career marketers displayed divergent foci. Both early and later career marketers appear focused on the elements of marketing which are aligned to their mindset, while a subsequent lack of knowledge and skills in the areas outside the scope of their mindset became apparent. Study findings also provide a more nuanced insight into literature and suggest that the marketing profession should not be viewed as a homogenous group as issues may not be pervasive to marketing. Instead, they appear to vary based on career stage. Study findings have potential implications across numerous areas such as policy, education and practice, while this study provides a foundation on which future research can build upon.

IGI Global Scientific Publishing.","Recently, a web-enabled e-recruiting emerged quickly as a powerful method for both job seekers and recruiters. E-recruiting has become an integral part both among job applicants and among recruiters. E-recruiting reduces costs for recruitment and selection, increases the number of suitable applicants, enables time savings for both recruiters and job applicants and improves the corporate image (Lang et al., 2011). E-recruiting has driven companies to redesign the recruiting process and to move quickly to web-based integrated human resource systems that provide standardized frameworks for key personnel processes (Cullen, 2001). Currently, corporate career web sites are among the most widely deployed e-business web sites (Maurer & Liu, 2007). Job seekers visit corporate career web sites to survey a job market in addition to searching for job opportunities. Recruiting via social networks such as Facebook and LinkedIn is also on the rise. In an attempt to use corporate websites to recruit job applicants from a labor market, employers have often found their hiring systems to be unexpectedly overwhelmed by large numbers of applications from poorly qualified individuals (Maurer & Cook, 2011). E-recruiting systems have evolved through numerous technological developments since its introduction in the mid-1990s. At the early stage of the corporate e-recruiting system, the purpose of the career web site was to simply post job openings on the static web page for job seekers’ information (Lee, 2005). As e-commerce technologies advanced and recruiters gained more e-recruiting experience, the front-end e-recruiting systems added new features and functions, targeted job seekers better, and integrated with a back-end human resource management system. An advanced e-recruiting system of large companies has been powered by an enterprise-wide system and incorporated best practice recruiting methodologies to achieve strategic advantage. The main purposes of this chapter are to give an update on the various e-recruiting sources and to review opportunities and challenges in developing and managing e-recruiting. This chapter is organized as follows: Section 2 compares the traditional recruiting and e-recruiting processes. Section 3 discusses seven major categories of the e-recruiting sources. Finally this chapter concludes with the discussions of opportunities, challenges, and future e-recruiting research directions.",https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-4666-9787-4.CH010,https://www.igi-global.com/gateway/chapter/148954

18,"The Implications of Artificial Intelligence on the
Employment Sector","Rohan Dinkar Jadhav, Abhijit Banubakode",13 June 2024,International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research,"The rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are poised to revolutionize various sectors, significantly influencing the employment landscape. This research paper delves into the multifaceted impact of AI on job roles, workforce displacement, and the evolving job market. Utilizing a blend of theoretical frameworks and empirical studies, the paper scrutinizes the adoption of AI models, including machine learning and natural language processing, by companies aiming to automate and replace numerous tasks and job functions. AI technologies are increasingly capable of performing tasks that were traditionally carried out by humans, particularly those that are repetitive and structured. Industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and customer service are already experiencing substantial transformations due to AI-driven automation. For instance, AI-powered robots and algorithms are taking over assembly line work, warehouse management, and customer interactions through chatbots and virtual assistants. This trend is expected to accelerate, potentially leading to significant job losses and displacement in these sectors. The paper presents evidence from various studies highlighting the susceptibility of certain occupations to automation and the consequent risk of unemployment for workers engaged in these roles. However, the impact of AI on employment is not solely negative. The paper underscores the potential of AI to spur job creation in emerging industries and fields. As AI technologies advance, new job categories are likely to emerge, particularly in tech-centric domains such as AI development, data analysis, and cybersecurity. Moreover, AI can enhance productivity and innovation, leading to the growth of new business models and industries. For instance, the development and maintenance of AI systems require skilled professionals, thus creating opportunities in software engineering, AI ethics, and related fields. The paper discusses how these new roles can offset some of the job losses caused by automation. A crucial aspect of this transformation is the need for workforce reskilling and upskilling. The paper emphasizes that to mitigate the adverse effects of AI on employment, there is an urgent need for comprehensive reskilling initiatives. Workers must be equipped with new skills that are in demand in the AI-driven job market. This includes technical skills related to AI and data science, as well as soft skills such as problem-solving, creativity, and emotional intelligence, which are less susceptible to automation. The study highlights successful reskilling programs and initiatives undertaken by governments, educational institutions, and private companies, offering insights into effective strategies for workforce development. In addition to examining the direct impact on jobs, the paper explores the broader ethical considerations and policy implications of AI’s integration into the workplace. Ethical issues such as bias in AI algorithms, privacy concerns, and the potential for increased inequality are addressed. The paper calls for robust policy frameworks to ensure that the benefits of AI are equitably distributed and that the negative consequences are mitigated. This includes policies to support displaced workers, promote fair labour practices, and ensure transparency and accountability in AI deployment. The findings of this research contribute to the ongoing discourse on the societal and economic consequences of AI. By providing a nuanced analysis of both the challenges and opportunities presented by AI, the paper offers valuable insights for policymakers, employers, and workers. It emphasizes the importance of proactive and collaborative efforts among all stakeholders to navigate the evolving employment landscape shaped by AI. The paper concludes with recommendations for fostering an inclusive and resilient workforce capable of thriving in an AI-driven future.",https://doi.org/10.36948/ijfmr.2024.v06i03.22716,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2722/b27cd80a12824b8ea129d08eca8a2e9627aa.pdf

Vira, Al James",1 March 2012,Development and Change,"This article presents findings from a labour mobility survey of 250 former call centre agents in India's National Capital Region (September 2008) exploring individuals’ employment before, during and immediately after leaving India's high-profile call centre ‘industry’. These data are combined with forty-two in-depth interviews conducted in India's NCR (July 2006 to August 2008) with call centre agents, managers, ex-call centre agents, labour organizers and economic development officials, as well as representatives from different labour market intermediaries. The study gives a cautiously optimistic account about the call centre work and employment opportunities on offer in India's ‘IT Enabled Services – Business Processing Outsourcing’ (or ITES-BPO) industry, and their implications for young urban middle class graduates based on: (i) the movement of around one fifth of the ex-call centre agent sample into further study, facilitated by relatively high call centre salaries; (ii) the movement of ex-call centre agents into higher paying job roles in a wide range of sectors including banking, IT, insurance, marketing, real estate and telecommunications; and (iii) the development of transferable skills in Indian call centres that are recognized by ex-call centre agents and their subsequent employers as conferring a labour market advantage in other sectors of India's new service economy relative to colleagues without prior call centre work experience.",https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-7660.2012.01768.X,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7660.2012.01768.x
22,Entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial communities in India: does gender really play a role?,"Maheshkumar P. Joshi, Deepak Pandit, Shalini Rahul Tiwari, Archana Choudhary ",27 February 2024,Journal of Enterprising Communities: People and Places in the Global Economy,"Purpose
Using the extant literature review, this paper aims to explore the relationship between gender, entrepreneurial education (EE) and entrepreneurial intention (EI) in the Indian context, which the authors believe is a novel approach to this research stream. The authors also use career preparedness as a control variable to examine this relationship.


Design/methodology/approach
Data were collected from 368 undergraduate students across four Indian universities (one exclusively for female students) through a standard structured questionnaire. Additionally, rather than examining, EI has been treated as a monolithic construct; however, the authors conceptualize it as comprising three different dimensions that include grand vision and risk-taking ability; opportunity exploitation; and ability to persevere. An additional analysis was conducted for the students who reported higher scores for “being well prepared for their careers” through their institutes’ academic programs and communities of entrepreneurs. The authors also interviewed some entrepreneurship instructors, who confirmed the present findings through their observations.


Findings
The findings indicate that, essentially, there is a positive relationship between EE and EI. The authors find that male students scored higher for the first two dimensions of EI but not the third. Additionally, the authors used career preparedness as a control variable for additional analysis. The authors observed that students with higher “career preparedness” reported a positive relationship between EE and EI, independent of gender, for all three dimensions of EI. Thus, it may be assumed that if a community of entrepreneurs needs to be developed in India, a focus on career preparedness is critical.


Research limitations/implications
First, given that the present survey reflected a single moment in linking EE to EI (which may be considered a limitation of the study), future researchers might focus on a longitudinal approach. Second, all the respondents are attending urban universities (and, as such, very likely belong to the upper middle class of Indian society). The financial divide between urban and rural India is well known; as such, the results might be different if the sample was drawn from rural and poor India.


Originality/value
The salience/value of this study lies in the conceptualization of EI comprising three sub-constructs to understand the impact of formal EE (with three sub-constructs) on EI. The focus on career preparedness for a female student is a new direction of inquiry with respect to entrepreneurial intention.",https://doi.org/10.1108/jec-10-2022-0145,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jec-10-2022-0145/full/html
23,From jobs to careers: drivers and barriers to career development in emerging labor markets,"Wang Luwei, Huimin Ma",6 November 2024,Frontiers in Sociology,"Introduction This study aims to reveal the intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of career development in emerging labor markets and to explore the impact of these drivers and barriers on career development. With the rapid transformation of global industrial structure, career development in emerging industries such as artificial intelligence, big data, new energy and e-commerce is gradually attracting attention. Methods This study utilizes a mixed research method of questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The research team distributed a total of 700 questionnaires to practitioners in China, the United States, Japan, Germany and India, and collected interview data from 20 industry practitioners. These data were analyzed from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives to analyze the drivers and barriers to career development, and structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationship between career motivation, barriers, social networks, and career satisfaction. Results The results indicate that career development motivation significantly and positively influences career satisfaction, while individuals with high career satisfaction perceive fewer career barriers. In addition, career barriers significantly influenced individuals’ perceptions of career discrimination. The study also found that social networks play an important supportive role in career development, and that extensive social networks increase career satisfaction. Individuals with high motivation were more resilient in the face of external barriers and were willing to retrain to improve their occupational skills. Discussion To promote career development in emerging industries, labor market policies should optimize and create fair and inclusive work environments for emerging industries. By eliminating gender, age, and racial discrimination and providing employee support programs, career development satisfaction and opportunities can be effectively enhanced. Conclusion Rapid technological updates, high work pressure, and cross-cultural barriers in emerging industries are the main challenges to career development today. This study suggests that governments and enterprises should jointly provide flexible vocational training and support policies to help practitioners adapt to the rapidly changing occupational environment.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2024.1486871,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/69d1/9a04ab47c5587978b77e9895975d32855f99.pdf
24,What kinds of career options do rural disadvantaged youth want to know about? Career needs assessment framework and findings from two different contexts in India,"J. Joshi, Anuradha J. Bakshi",27 November 2019,British Journal of Guidance & Counselling," In this paper, we present a framework to examine the kinds of careers that rural disadvantaged youth would like to know about in a career guidance intervention as also related findings from two different rural disadvantaged contexts in India. Differences across gender, age group, region, and participation/non-participation in youth programmes are also explored. The results validate the importance of comprehensive career needs assessment and provide specific directions for designing and adapting career guidance interventions for rural disadvantaged youth. Implications for research and practice are discussed in general as well as for the specific contexts included in this study.

25,"Education Abroad: engineering, privatization, and the new middle class in neoliberalizing India",A. Khandekar,1 December 2013,Engineering Studies,"In this essay, I examine ‘Education Abroad’– the large-scale migration of engineering students from India to the USA for seeking graduate education. I argue that Education Abroad in contemporary India is articulated at the intersection of multiple factors at different scales. These include imaginations of successful careers and lifestyles as well as frustrations with state-sponsored higher education in India – factors which, in turn, are themselves located within particular histories of (post)colonialism, developmentalism, and more recently, neoliberalism. Drawing on historical analysis and ethnographic research conducted among engineering students in Mumbai, India, and various parts of the USA, I trace ways in which Indian engineers make sense of and navigate through the intersections of these various historical and contemporary currents and the particular shape of Education Abroad that emerges as a result. Moreover, I suggest, in pursuing Education Abroad, these engineers inadvertently undermine the very systems of higher education of which they are legacy beneficiaries.
